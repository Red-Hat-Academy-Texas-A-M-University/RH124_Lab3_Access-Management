# RH124 Lab5 Outline

* The engineers set up a deployment script for your service, but they did a really bad job (can't blame them, the deadlines were tight). Regardless, you need to fix it. 
  - You need to make sure that anyone in the deployment group has access to run the deployment script and qa cannot access any of the secrets in secrets.txt. 
  - The qa group does not exist yet. 
  - We'll also need a new user, Tim. 
  - He's an intern so he doesn't get access to secrets either, just the script. 
  - Speaking of which, the old intern, Jack, never had permissions revoked. You better change his password or something to make sure he can't login again. 
  - Jack's old stuff is in ~/files/jack, make sure they get transferred in ownership to Tim so he can continue Jack's legacy.

Hint: when you run the start script, you'll automatically become a different user. Not every user has the same sudo user.

= The script runs and creates a dummy deploy.sh script and secrets.txt, along with the deployment group. The user gets su'd into the deployer user whose sudo is devops who can change the permissions on files like deploy.sh and secrets.txt (deployer does not have access to do that).
