# RH124 Lab5 Outline

* The engineers set up a deployment script for your service, but they did a really bad job (can't blame them, the deadlines were tight). Regardless, you need to fix it. 
  - You need to make sure that anyone in the "**deployment**" group and ONLY the deployment group has access to run the deployment script (**/opt/files/deploy.sh**).
  - The "**qa**" group does not exist yet. Go ahead and create it. Add our qa team "**john**" and "**martin**" to it.
  - We'll also need a new user, "**tim**", he'll be joining our deployment team
  - Speaking of which, the old intern, "**jack**", never had permissions revoked. You better lock his account to make sure he can't login again. 
  - Jack's old stuff is in **/opt/files/jack**, make sure they get transferred in ownership to **tim** so he can continue Jack's legacy. Don't change the name though.
  - As you know, our former VP is also under investigation from the FBI, so we currently have a litigation hold on all his files. Go ahead and make sure no one but the **legal** group can read "**/opt/files/montgomery**" and NO ONE should be able to write to it

Hint: when you run the start script, you'll automatically become a different user. Not every user has the same sudo user.

= The script runs and creates a dummy deploy.sh script and secrets.txt, along with the deployment group. The user gets su'd into the deployer user whose sudo is devops who can change the permissions on files like deploy.sh and secrets.txt (deployer does not have access to do that).
